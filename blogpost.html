															<h2>REVEALING THE DISEAT.ME</h2>
															<p>Have you heard of “diseat.me” before? I doubt because I rarely come 
																across people use this site, in fact since I know about this, I have not
																seen another person make use of it except I introduce them to it.
																I learned about it during my course in Google Digital Skill for Africa,
																its use and relevant and I have decided to share it with you today.</p>

															<p>Diseat.me (www.diseat.me) is website that is used to find out where and 
																which of the website you Google Mail (gmail) have being registered with either 
																with your knowledge or not, I mean website you have intentionally or unintentionally 
																registered yourself with gmail.</p>

															<h2>THE LOST VALUE</h2>
															<p>Oh it was hilarious when this topic came into my brain stream to my mind and 
																I began to type it as my system password before it displayed wrong password and I
																grasped am not in my text editor yet.</p>
															<p>I was about seven to eight years old, very much younger then when I have that 
																interest in reading anything at all that comes across my eyes, I mean anything at all. 
																During my nursery/primary school, when my mum will want to wash my school uniform, the pieces 
																of paper she will packed out of my school bag and my short pocket will almost be equal volume 
																to my exercise books. She will complained that is it any pieces of paper that you see that you
																will pick?</p>

															<h2>HOW I FELT WHEN SHE HUGGED ME</h2>
															<p>That faithful morning when I decided to visit them once more since I wasn’t working there anymore,
																I met her standing with her husband at the entrance of the computer school.</p>
															<p>But before I continue, few days ago that morning when she was introduced to me as one of my new 
															students in the computer school. I said, “Welcome ma, nice meeting you, thank you for taking this 
															decision to learn computer and you will never regret it”. I can perceive from her look, as she look 
															at me from head to toe, maybe thinking this small boy will be the one to teach me?</p>
